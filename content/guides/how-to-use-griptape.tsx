    <p>Griptape takes a pragmatic stance: keep sensitive data out of the prompt, enforce rules with structured Rulesets, and separate what the agent reasons about (Tasks) from what it remembers (Memory). It&rsquo;s designed for teams that want agent behaviour they can actually reason about in production.</p>
    <h2>What it is</h2>
    <p>The core building blocks are Structures (Agent, Pipeline, Workflow), Tasks (prompt, tool, code-exec), Tools (callable integrations), Rulesets (constraints), and Drivers (pluggable model/storage backends). Its signature feature is &ldquo;off-prompt&rdquo; data: large tool outputs land in Task Memory, and the model references them by handle instead of stuffing them back into context.</p>
    <h2>Install / sign up</h2>
    <pre>{`# Python 3.9+
pip install griptape

# Set a model provider key
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
# or ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, or configure any Driver

# Optional hosted platform: https://cloud.griptape.ai`}</pre>
    <h2>First session</h2>
    <p>Instantiate an Agent, give it tools, and run a prompt. Griptape handles the tool-calling loop, memory, and rule enforcement for you.</p>
    <pre>{`$ python
from griptape.structures import Agent
from griptape.tools import WebScraperTool, FileManagerTool
from griptape.rules import Ruleset, Rule

agent = Agent(
    tools=[WebScraperTool(off_prompt=True), FileManagerTool()],
    rulesets=[Ruleset("safety", rules=[Rule("Never fetch URLs outside example.com")])],
)
agent.run("Summarise https://example.com/pricing into pricing.md")`}</pre>
    <h2>Everyday workflows</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1. Build a Pipeline where each Task&rsquo;s output feeds the next &mdash; handy for scrape to summarise to email flows.</li>
      <li>2. Use Workflow (DAG-style) when Tasks can run in parallel, like fanning out research over multiple sources.</li>
      <li>3. Store large artifacts in Task Memory so subsequent Tasks can reference them without the model ever seeing the raw bytes.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Gotchas and tips</h2>
    <p>The off-prompt pattern is the headline feature and also the easiest thing to misconfigure &mdash; set off_prompt=True on any tool whose output could blow up your <a href="/learn/context-window">context window</a> or leak PII. Rulesets are soft constraints enforced through prompting, so combine them with hard guardrails (allowlists, sandboxing) for anything safety-critical.</p>
    <p>Drivers make it easy to swap OpenAI for Anthropic or a local model, but embedding and vector store Drivers must be configured consistently across a pipeline &mdash; mismatched dims will silently degrade retrieval. The Griptape Cloud hosted runner is useful for long-running jobs you don&rsquo;t want on your laptop.</p>
    <h2>Who it&rsquo;s for</h2>
    <p>Python teams building agents that touch real data &mdash; scraping, ETL, customer comms &mdash; and need composition, rules, and off-prompt memory more than a sprawling plugin ecosystem.</p>
