    <p>AnythingLLM from Mintplex Labs is a batteries-included chat-with-your-documents platform. It handles ingestion, embedding, vector storage, <a href="/learn/llm">LLM</a> routing, and a clean workspace UI so you don&rsquo;t have to wire five services together. You get a desktop build for personal use and a Docker image for team deployments.</p>
    <h2>What it is</h2>
    <p>A Node/React app that organizes knowledge into workspaces. Each workspace has its own documents, vector namespace, <a href="/learn/system-prompt">system prompt</a>, and permitted users. It supports dozens of LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, LM Studio, Azure) and swappable vector stores (LanceDB by default, Pinecone, Qdrant, Chroma, Weaviate).</p>
    <h2>Install / set up</h2>
    <pre>{`# docker
docker pull mintplexlabs/anythingllm
docker run -d -p 3001:3001 \\
  --cap-add SYS_ADMIN \\
  -v anythingllm_storage:/app/server/storage \\
  mintplexlabs/anythingllm`}</pre>
    <h2>First run</h2>
    <p>Hit <code>http://localhost:3001</code>, walk through onboarding, pick an LLM provider, and drop in an API key. Create a workspace, upload a few PDFs or point it at a website, and start chatting &mdash; embeddings happen in the background.</p>
    <pre>{`$ curl -F "file=@whitepaper.pdf" \\
  http://localhost:3001/api/v1/document/upload
{"success": true, "location": "..."}`}</pre>
    <h2>Everyday workflows</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Build a workspace per project or per client so contexts never leak between them.</li>
      <li>Enable the Agent tab to let the workspace call web search, scrape pages, or run SQL via custom skills.</li>
      <li>Expose the workspace as an embeddable chat widget on a marketing site with a scoped API key.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Gotchas and tips</h2>
    <p>The desktop app and the Docker server store data in different locations and don&rsquo;t sync. Pick one deployment model up front. If you start on desktop and later move to Docker, you&rsquo;ll re-ingest everything &mdash; there&rsquo;s no migration path.</p>
    <p>Default chunking is generic. For dense technical docs, bump chunk size and overlap in the workspace settings before ingesting, otherwise retrieval quality suffers. Re-embedding after changing chunking is a manual delete-and-reupload today.</p>
    <h2>Who it&rsquo;s for</h2>
    <p>Small teams that need a private, multi-tenant RAG chat without building one. If you want ChatGPT-over-your-docs with user management and you don&rsquo;t want to touch LangChain, AnythingLLM is the shortest path.</p>
