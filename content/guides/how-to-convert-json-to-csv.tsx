    <p>
      JSON and CSV are the two formats data bounces between most
      often. JSON is nested and hierarchical; CSV is flat and
      tabular. Converting between them sounds trivial and usually
      is, until you hit the edges: nested objects, arrays as
      values, mixed schemas, special characters, tens of millions
      of rows, or Excel&rsquo;s opinions about what a CSV looks
      like. This guide covers the conversion rules that actually
      matter, how to handle nested data (flatten vs spread),
      encoding and delimiter pitfalls, <a href="/learn/stream">streaming</a> for large files,
      the Excel quirks that break normal CSVs, and when to reach
      for a proper ETL pipeline instead.

    <h2>The happy-path conversion</h2>
    <p>
      JSON that&rsquo;s already tabular (array of flat objects) maps
      1:1 to CSV:
    </p>
    <pre>
{`[
  { "name": "Alice", "age": 30, "city": "NYC" },
  { "name": "Bob", "age": 25, "city": "LA" }
]`}
    </pre>
    <p>Becomes:</p>
    <pre>
{`name,age,city
Alice,30,NYC
Bob,25,LA`}
    </pre>
    <p>
      Header row uses object keys. Column order is either
      insertion order or alphabetical (choose explicitly — don&rsquo;t
      let your tool decide).
    </p>

    <h2>Nested data — flatten or spread</h2>
    <p>
      Nested JSON doesn&rsquo;t fit in flat CSV. Three common
      strategies:
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Dot-path flatten:</strong>{" "}
      <code>user.address.city</code> becomes a column named{" "}
      <code>user.address.city</code>. Clean for single-level
      nesting; awkward for deep or variable structures.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>JSON-in-cell:</strong> put nested objects or arrays
      as escaped JSON strings in a single column:{" "}
      <code>{`"[{\\"id\\":1}]"`}</code>. Preserves everything, but
      you can&rsquo;t analyze it without re-parsing.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Explode:</strong> turn an array into multiple rows,
      duplicating parent fields. One row per array element. Lossy
      in the reverse direction (can&rsquo;t reconstruct the
      original structure).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Choose based on consumer:</strong> analysts in Excel
      want exploded rows; data warehouses want dot-paths; export
      pipelines want JSON-in-cell.
    </p>

    <h2>Schema variance — when rows have different keys</h2>
    <p>
      If JSON objects don&rsquo;t all share the same keys, CSV
      forces a choice:
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Union headers:</strong> include every key that
      appears anywhere. Rows leave unused cells empty. Default for
      most converters.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Intersection headers:</strong> include only keys
      present in every row. Drops data but produces consistent
      rows.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>First-object schema:</strong> use only keys from the
      first object. Silently drops data from later rows that have
      extra keys. Avoid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Union is usually what you want. Warn the user (or log) when
      rows have missing keys so they know data gaps exist.
    </p>

    <h2>Quoting and escaping</h2>
    <p>
      CSV rules (per RFC 4180):
    </p>
    <p>
      Fields containing commas, newlines, or double quotes must be
      wrapped in double quotes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Double quotes inside a quoted field are escaped by doubling:{" "}
      <code>{`"She said \\"hi\\""`}</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Newlines inside quoted fields are literal — parsers must
      handle multi-line rows.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Gotcha:</strong> many tools (and people) fail on
      newlines in fields. Some normalize to spaces; some corrupt
      the CSV; some produce broken output that opens in Excel
      anyway.
    </p>

    <h2>Delimiter wars</h2>
    <p>
      CSV is &ldquo;comma-separated values&rdquo; — except when
      it&rsquo;s not.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Comma (,):</strong> US default. Breaks on international
      data with European number formats.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Semicolon (;):</strong> European default. Excel uses
      it for locales where comma is the decimal separator (France,
      Germany).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Tab (\t):</strong> &ldquo;TSV.&rdquo; Safer than comma
      because tab rarely appears in real text.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Pipe (|):</strong> sometimes used for data exchange.
      Even rarer in natural text.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Rule:</strong> TSV is easier than CSV to produce
      correctly but harder for humans to eyeball. For shipping
      data between systems, prefer TSV. For end users in Excel,
      use locale-aware CSV.
    </p>

    <h2>Encoding — UTF-8 with (or without) BOM</h2>
    <p>
      CSV files have no header declaring their encoding. You find
      out by trying.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>UTF-8 without BOM:</strong> universal default.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>UTF-8 with BOM:</strong> Excel on Windows needs the
      BOM to auto-detect UTF-8. Without it, non-ASCII characters
      (é, ñ, 日) display as garbage on Excel Windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>CP1252 / Windows-1252:</strong> legacy encoding some
      Windows tools export by default. Breaks on any character
      outside the 255 it supports.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>UTF-16:</strong> some Excel versions save as UTF-16
      if you &ldquo;Save as Unicode Text.&rdquo; Uncommon now but
      stare at failing imports and you&rsquo;ll see it eventually.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Serving CSV for Excel?</strong> UTF-8 with BOM.
      Otherwise UTF-8 without BOM.
    </p>

    <h2>Large files — stream, don&rsquo;t load</h2>
    <p>
      Loading a 500MB JSON file into memory to write CSV → OOM.
      Stream:
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Streaming JSON parsers:</strong> JavaScript{" "}
      <code>stream-json</code>, Python <code>ijson</code>, Go{" "}
      <code>jsonitr</code>. Read objects one at a time as the file
      is read.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Streaming CSV writers:</strong> write row-by-row as
      you read JSON. Flush often. Back-pressure if writing to
      network.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Line-delimited JSON (NDJSON):</strong> if your source
      is already one JSON object per line, converting is trivial —
      read line, parse, write CSV row, repeat. Often the best
      choice for data warehousing.
    </p>

    <h2>Excel&rsquo;s opinions</h2>
    <p>
      Excel thinks it knows what your CSV should look like. It
      doesn&rsquo;t.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Leading zeros stripped:</strong>{" "}
      <code>01234</code> becomes <code>1234</code>. Force text by
      prefixing with <code>=&quot;01234&quot;</code> or formatting
      the column as text after import.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Scientific notation for long numbers:</strong>{" "}
      <code>1234567890123456</code> becomes{" "}
      <code>1.23457E+15</code>. Long IDs, phone numbers, credit
      card numbers all corrupt.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Dates reformatted:</strong> <code>2026-04-22</code>
      {" "}might become <code>22/04/2026</code> or <code>4/22/2026</code>
      {" "}depending on locale. Pre-format as text or use ISO 8601
      strings the user won&rsquo;t autoformat.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Gene names turned into dates:</strong> famous gotcha
      — SEPT1 becomes 1-Sep. Affects bioinformatics so much that
      some genes were renamed to avoid Excel.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Save-as-CSV round-trip corrupts:</strong> Excel saves
      CSVs in locale-specific format. Open, save, and CSVs can
      change delimiter, encoding, and date format silently.
    </p>

    <h2>CSV to JSON — the reverse</h2>
    <p>
      Similar rules, reversed:
    </p>
    <p>
      Header row → JSON keys.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each data row → one JSON object.
    </p>
    <p>
      Type <a href="/learn/inference">inference</a>: try to parse as number, fallback to string.
      Some converters infer booleans and nulls; some don&rsquo;t.
      Be explicit about your type expectations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Missing values: empty string, <code>null</code>, or missing
      key? Pick one and document it.
    </p>

    <h2>When CSV is the wrong format</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Deeply nested data:</strong> CSV loses structure.
      Use JSONL or Parquet.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Files &gt; 10GB:</strong> Parquet or Arrow for
      columnar analytics; CSV is slow.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Typed data that matters:</strong> JSON or Parquet
      preserve types; CSV loses them.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Binary content:</strong> never CSV. Base64 encode
      into JSON, or use a binary-native format.
    </p>

    <h2>Common mistakes</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Assuming comma is safe.</strong> Any text with a
      comma — addresses, descriptions, quoted text — must be
      properly quoted. Use the library, don&rsquo;t concatenate.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Forgetting the header row.</strong> CSV without
      headers is ambiguous. Always include headers unless the
      format explicitly forbids them.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Mixing quoted and unquoted fields inconsistently.</strong>
      RFC 4180 allows it; parsers often don&rsquo;t. Quote
      everything or nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Using Excel as the converter.</strong> Excel corrupts
      numbers, dates, and encoding. Script the conversion; use
      Excel to view.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Ignoring line endings.</strong> CRLF (Windows) vs LF
      (Unix) can break naive parsers. RFC 4180 says CRLF; reality
      is messier.
